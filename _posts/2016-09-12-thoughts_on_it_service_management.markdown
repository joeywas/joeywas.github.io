I'm not usually one that postulates on the big picture stuff.   But as my career has moved forward, I've come to realize how important it is to have an IT service management (ITSM) mindset.  An ITSM mindset means that instead of focusing on technology, my focus is on business needs and finding appropriate solutions.   Instead of thinking about servers, I need to be considering services.  Instead of custom or ad-hoc solutions, I need to be thinking about automation.

| Old thinking | New thinking |

| Fixing things | Preventing problems |
| Users | Customers |
| Data silos | Enterprise data |
| I'm the IT Guy | I'm a solutions provider |
